# Computer Vision And Generative AI

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) generates a mask around the specified object, selecting the most accurate one. The app allows users to change the background while keeping the subject or modify the subject while retaining the background. Users can accept the generated mask or refine it by adding more points. Once the mask is finalized, users input a text description (and optionally a negative prompt) to select a new background for the object. This background is created using a text-to-image diffusion model and displayed as the final result.
